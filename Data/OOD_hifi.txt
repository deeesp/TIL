their fragrance

slowly he obeyed dumb with fatigue but inexpressibly grateful
don't you like it
some made by the feet of a woman some by the feet of a man
there was no possible doubt about it
oh that you would dare
she said but she stole a glance at him in spite of herself
she knew that she had said too much but she went on coldly
what is the matter jane
has anything happened
wide open
well daddy
you forgave me didn't you
carelessly
reflectively
do you think so
she stopped and he remained silent his head averted

the other machine came alongside at their right and the men jumped down just as cyril threw open the left hand door and doris leaped out and went through the gate in the hedge
but even now she wondered whether it would not have been wiser if she had taken her father into her confidence and had the gardeners out to keep an eye open for suspicious characters

go you little wretch
how he measured me that magnificent rustic
this rascal has a right to some consideration
here you fellows take all these things back again and that quickly
and they accuse us daughters of the nobility of being proud
the injustice of the proposed measure incensed me that is all
unfortunately
but to reject a soldier who comes to you voluntarily would be a fault for which your associate would have a right to call you to account
he had been so completely blinded by passion that he would not have been likely to discover the real condition of affairs even if no pains had been taken to deceive him

poor deluded creatures

wife where is your energy
how was this danger to be averted
what must be done
he was evidently surprised that this young man should have had so little courage as to remain in the shelter of the fireside while his father was leading the peasants on to battle
let peaceable citizens take courage let the evil disposed tremble
come
he reflected a moment then added
we have distrusted him but we should ask his pardon
then what was to become of his wife and his son
these were placed in such a way that it was impossible for him to put out his head and see how far he was above the ground
could it be that they had been refused access to the prison
hope courage
what did all this mean
a hasty movement and he would have fallen
no filaments no rough bits of hemp as usual after a break
the spirit was strong but the flesh shuddered
he exclaimed delightedly
i do not understand your question he retorted angrily
now reflect shall i expect you on wednesday
the poor peasant who made his breakfast off a crust and a bit of onion had lavished a small fortune on the decorations of this apartment

he did not seem to hear her and in the same tone he continued
she saw plainly that by profiting by the crime of her niece she had been as culpable as if she had aided her in committing it
i had just irately blamed a printer for a blunder of my own
from casual employment as a reporter i had worked my way up to my present position
thus it had been left to the casual remark of a nameless printer and an instance of my own failing powers to break the spell that ambition and habit were weaving
the air was close the sky leaden even the birds would not sing
why had i come to the country
the upper lip from where i sat seemed one half of cupid's bow
do i wish men only to read our paper
am i a turk holding the doctrine that women have no souls no minds
then how was i a man to interpret the world to women
was my presence the cause of the spiritual paralysis
what right have you to approach such a creature
would you drag her into the turmoil of your world because she would be a solace
are not heaven's best gifts best won by giving all for them
it was just the meeting which as a weary man i needed
why was she laughing at me
what man is safe a moment
resolving to explore a little i said
indeed she can make it a tasteful expression of herself
conscious that my homily was growing rather long i concluded
what more is there to say about them
miss warren is a genuine woman one after your own heart
she looked at me hastily and her face grew pale
will your conscience permit you to teach me a little topography
well it may seem very silly to you but i can't help it
do you know where any of these birds live
well prove that i don't
oh yes i have a broad charity for all of his kind
if we don't know what we know we don't know anything
do you realize that your philosophy would stop half the industries of the world
reuben sat down on the piazza in his quiet undemonstrative way
it haunts me oppresses me
would the mother and her two daughters survive
miss warren will help me and i think all will be well
flushing deeply
very harmless
regretful interest
what shall be the first entry on the blank page of my wakening mind
a plague on my memory i exclaimed
haven't you given that up yet
why did she fall into painful and even piteous confusion
was it my imagination or did she slightly shrink from him
because our lord was a man of sorrows was he in love with sorrows
it's impossible
it would be like her to recognize that a love so unthrifty and unselfish must spring from the deepest truths and needs of her being rather than from any passing causes

good night and good luck to you the two young officers halted at a discreet distance until john cameron had turned off to the right and walked away into the darkness

poor little useless woman that she was
he was glad when the orders came for him and five other fellows to tramp across the camp to the gas school and go through two solid hours of instruction ending with a practical illustration of the gas mask and a good dose of gas
she was glad to make an excuse to get away and she drove her little car around by the way of john cameron's home hoping perhaps to get a glimpse of his mother again
somehow the deference paid to his uniform got into his blood and made him feel that people all along the line really did care for what the boys were doing for them
but they were fellow townsmen and had gone to school together
surely he knew him
there had been a look in his face a set look
you knew what i came for and you did it on purpose
whether he was worthy or not they should not do this thing to him
if she only knew which way he had gone
now he said as he put the car to its best speed and switched on its headlights again
well suppose he were
somewhere in the watches of the night a memory came to him of the covenant he had made that day and a vague wistful reaching of his heart after the christ to whom he was supposed to have surrendered his life
those words he had called cameron's father
you know that it's to cover up your own vile deeds and to excuse your own lustful passions that you talk this way and try to persuade your hearts and consciences that you are no worse than the girls you have dishonored
she was willing to come with his mother
cameron stepped down from the philadelphia train at the small country station that had suddenly become an important point because of the great camp that had sprung up within a stone's throw of it
that was eccentric queer but it would be perfectly respectable
questionable
she could not help thinking how wonderful it would have been if there had been no war and her dear boy could have had this sweet wholesome girl for a friend
her aunt was away from home with an invalid friend on a short trip so there had been no one to question ruth's movements when she decided to run down to washington with a friend from the red cross and incidentally visit the camp a little while
i may never come home but i'll find god anyhow
this was france
oh if he could just hear a word from home
sunny france
they adored her
but he came
i'm sure i saw it move there
he probably would but the idea was not attractive just now
he had said he would marry her he a married man
when he had her settled on the canvas with sweet ferns and grass underneath for a pillow and his own blanket spread over her he set about gathering wood for a fire
she found herself glad of the wideness of the desert and the stillness of the night that shut out the world and made their most unusual relationship possible for a little while

she knew by that exalted look of renunciation upon his face that no longing whatsoever could make him overstep the bounds which he had laid down between her soul and his
hazel turned back to the letter and went on reading to hide the tears that were gathering in her own eyes as she looked upon the exalted face of the mother
she would have preferred to have had her run down to lakewood for a few weeks and then follow her brother across the water for a year or two of travel

he spoke briefly of his being laid up lamed in the indian reservation and his deep grief that he had been unable to come east to be beside his mother during her last hours

then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist
but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint
the result of these reflections was that d'artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible

there being still about twenty thousand acres to be recovered this was achieved in eighteen sixty five when two hundred thousand acres had been reforested at an expense of about two million dollars and an additional expense of seven hundred thousand dollars to organize the newly formed pine forests
to facilitate regeneration a superficial culture of the soil is also advocated
the first general forest code however dates from sixteen forty seven which among other useless prescriptions made the existing usage of planting two trees for every one cut obligatory and this provision remained on the statutes until seventeen eighty nine
the royal ordinance of eighteen sixty six resulted which was to regulate the cutting on settled lands and in such new settlements as were thereafter allowed

secondly the vibrations of its physical particles are perceptible
it consequently frequently happens that a psychic or medium going to a house where such manifestations are taking place may be able to discover what the entity who produces them is attempting to say or do
some writers have spoken of it under the name elementary but as that title has at one time or other been used for almost every variety of post mortem entity
that is to say they either have been or will be men like ourselves
it is obvious that they used the latter word simply as a synonym for constituent parts without in the least degree intending it to connote the idea of substances which could not be further reduced
before leaving this branch of the subject it may be well to warn the student against the confusion of thought into which some have fallen through failing to distinguish this elemental essence which we have been considering from the monadic essence manifesting through the mineral kingdom
it is not however able to do this quite immediately
so many and so varied are the subdivisions of this class that to do them anything like justice one would need to devote a separate treatise to this subject alone
some among the many subdivisions of this class are much less childlike and more dignified than those we have been describing
if it is sufficiently powerful to seize upon and inhabit some passing shell it frequently does so
to such a man an accurate comprehension of the effect of thought and desire in producing artificial elementals would come as a horrifying revelation
it would be the greatest consolation to many devoted and grateful souls who are oppressed with the feeling that they are unable to do anything in return for the kindness lavished upon them by their benefactors
all readers of the literature of such subjects are aware that many of our ancient families are supposed to have associated with them a traditional death warning
in thinking of the adepts and schools of occultism of that remarkable people our minds instinctively revert to the evil practices of which we hear so much in connection with their latter days
there is little doubt that the movement increased so much more rapidly than they had expected that it soon got quite beyond their control

this authorized the admission of one hundred fifty three thousand seven hundred fourteen immigrants based on a total of one hundred fifty thousand plus minimum quotas of one hundred for all countries
the most recent step in the legislative declaration of a maximum quota was in the act of nineteen fifty two which set a maximum authorization of one hundred fifty four thousand six hundred fifty seven
the platform of the republican party then called the union party which abraham lincoln helped to write in eighteen sixty four
the only question that i think worries the committee is whether the use of the eighteen ninety census or the use of the method based on naturalization is the more plausible method of attaining that discrimination which is the object we are all seeking

the law provides for the issuance of a certificate of identity to a person in a foreign country whose claim to united states citizenship is rejected and who desires to proceed to the united states in order to attempt to obtain a judicial declaration confirming his claim to american citizenship
it deals with an alien who is outside the united states and who is not in a position to claim procedural protections equal to those accorded to an alien who has established residence in the united states
